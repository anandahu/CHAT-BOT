# CHAT-BOT

A comprehensive, open-source chatbot project by [anandahu](https://github.com/anandahu/CHAT-BOT) that enables conversational AI on both web and Android platforms. This repository is designed for learning, experimentation, and extension, providing a clear structure and modular code for both front-end and back-end development.

## Project Structure & File Explanations


### Android App (`Chatbot_android/`)

- **MainActivity.java**  
  The main entry point for the Android app. Handles UI initialization, user input, and displaying messages in the chat interface.

- **ChatBotLogic.java**  
  Contains the core logic for generating responses to user input. Typically uses simple rule-based methods or connects to a backend.

- **activity_main.xml**  
  Defines the UI layout for the chat screen (input box, send button, chat history).

- **strings.xml**  
  Stores UI strings for easy localization.

- **AndroidManifest.xml**  
  Declares app permissions and main activity.

- **build.gradle**  
  Build configuration for the Android app.

### Web App (`app/`)

- **index.html**  
  The main web page. Contains the chat UI structure: chat window, input field, and send button.

- **style.css**  
  Styles the chat interface for a modern look and responsive design.

- **main.js**  
  Handles all client-side logic:
  - Captures user input
  - Displays messages in the chat window
  - Sends user messages to the chatbot backend (if present)
  - Displays bot responses

### Backend Chatbot (`chatbot/`)

- **chatbot.py**  
  The core chatbot logic, typically a Python script. Handles:
  - Receiving user input (possibly via HTTP API)
  - Generating AI or rule-based responses
  - Returning responses to the front-end

- **requirements.txt**  
  Lists Python dependencies for the backend (e.g., Flask for API, NLTK for NLP).

### Root Files

- **.gitignore**  
  Specifies files and folders to be ignored by Git (e.g., build artifacts, IDE files).

- **README.md**  
  This documentation file.

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository



### 2. Web App

- Open `app/index.html` in your browser for local demo.
- To connect to a backend:
  - Make sure the backend server (see below) is running.
  - Update the API endpoint in `main.js` if necessary.

### 3. Backend Chatbot


- By default, this starts a local server (e.g., on `http://localhost:5000`) that receives user messages and returns bot responses.

### 4. Android App

- Open `Chatbot_android/` in Android Studio.
- Build and run on an emulator or device.
- The app may use internal logic or connect to the backend server for responses (check `ChatBotLogic.java`).

---

## Usage

### Web Chatbot

1. Open the web app in your browser.
2. Type your message and press "Send".
3. The bot responds in the chat window.

### Android Chatbot

1. Launch the app on your device.
2. Enter your message and tap "Send".
3. The bot replies in the chat interface.

---

## Customization & Extension

- **Change Bot Responses:**  
  Edit `chatbot/chatbot.py` or `ChatBotLogic.java` for new responses or smarter logic.

- **UI Improvements:**  
  Update `app/style.css` or Android XML layouts for a new look.

- **Add Features:**  
  - Integrate with external APIs (weather, news, etc.)
  - Add authentication or user profiles
  - Enhance NLP with libraries like spaCy or GPT APIs

- **Connect Web & Android to Backend:**  
  Ensure both clients send HTTP requests to the backend and handle responses asynchronously.
